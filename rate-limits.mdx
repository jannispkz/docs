## Overview

The Pikzels API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all users.

<Info>
  **Default Limit:** Maximum of **10 concurrent requests** per API key
  
  **Enterprise:** Higher limits available upon request - [contact us](mailto:support@pikzels.com)
</Info>

## How Rate Limiting Works

Unlike traditional rate limits based on requests per minute, Pikzels uses a concurrent request model:

- You can have up to 10 requests processing at the same time
- Once a request completes, that slot becomes available immediately
- There's no time window - it's purely based on active concurrent requests

### Example Scenario

```
Step 1: Send 10 requests
        → All 10 accepted ✓ (all slots occupied)

Step 2: Request #1 completes
        → 1 slot opens, can send 1 more

Step 3: Requests #2-4 complete
        → 3 slots open, can send 3 more

Step 4: Try to send 4 requests
        → 3 accepted, 1 rejected (at 10-slot limit)
```

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the concurrent request limit, you'll receive a `429` error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "CONCURRENT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Concurrent Request Limit Reached",
    "details": "Maximum of 10 concurrent requests allowed. Please wait for existing requests to complete"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep track of how many requests are currently running
- Before sending a new request, check if you're at the 10-request limit
- If at limit, wait for existing requests to complete before sending new ones
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors (wait 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.)
- Consider using libraries like `p-limit` for JavaScript/Node.js or `asyncio.Semaphore` for Python
