Apply consistent artistic styles and aesthetics to your generated content by training on your visual references.

<Warning>
Training typically takes around 1 minute. You'll receive a unique style ID that you can use with the thumbnail and recreate endpoints once training is complete.
</Warning>

<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  Name for your style model (maximum 25 characters)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="training_data" type="string" required>
  URL to a publicly accessible zip file containing your style reference images
</ParamField>

## Image Requirements

- **File Format**: PNG or JPEG only
- **Image Count**: 1-3 images (if you include more than 3, only the first 3 will be used)
- **Individual File Size**: Maximum 8MB per image
- **Total Zip Size**: Maximum 200MB
- **Image Quality**: High-quality reference images that clearly show the desired style work best

## Training Process

1. **Upload**: Your zip file is downloaded and validated
2. **Processing**: Style elements are analyzed and extracted
3. **Training**: The AI model learns the artistic style
4. **Ready**: Your style is available for use in generation

</AccordionGroup>

## Using Your Trained Style

Once training is complete, use your style ID in generation endpoints:

```json
{
  "prompt": "futuristic cityscape",
  "format": "16:9", 
  "model": "pkz-3",
  "style": "xyz789ghi012"
}
```

## Next Steps

- Use [GET /v1/style](/api-reference/endpoint/style-status) to check training status
- Use your trained style in [thumbnail](/api-reference/endpoint/thumbnail) or [recreate](/api-reference/endpoint/recreate) generation
