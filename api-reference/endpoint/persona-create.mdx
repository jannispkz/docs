Create consistent character generation by training on specific people or characters from your image collection.

<Warning>
Training typically takes around 3 minutes. You'll receive a unique persona ID that you can use with the thumbnail, recreate, and faceswap endpoints once training is complete.
</Warning>

<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  Name for your persona model (maximum 25 characters)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="training_data" type="string" required>
  URL to a publicly accessible zip file containing your training images
</ParamField>

## Image Requirements

- **File Format**: PNG or JPEG only
- **Image Count**: 1-20 images (if you include more than 20, only the first 20 will be used)
- **Individual File Size**: Maximum 8MB per image
- **Total Zip Size**: Maximum 200MB
- **Image Quality**: High-quality, clear images work best for training

## Training Process

1. **Upload**: Your zip file is downloaded and validated
2. **Processing**: Images are analyzed and prepared for training
3. **Training**: The AI model learns from your images
4. **Ready**: Your persona is available for use in generation

<RequestExample>
```bash Example Request
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.pikzels.com/v1/persona' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "name": "My Character",
  "training_data": "https://example.com/training-images.zip"
}'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Response
{
  "status": "queued",
  "id": "abc123def456"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Using Your Trained Persona

Once training is complete, use your persona ID in generation endpoints:

```json
{
  "prompt": "epic adventure scene",
  "format": "16:9", 
  "model": "pkz-3",
  "persona": "abc123def456"
}
```

## Next Steps

- Use [GET /v1/persona](/api-reference/endpoint/persona-status) to check training status
- Use your trained persona in [thumbnail](/api-reference/endpoint/thumbnail), [recreate](/api-reference/endpoint/recreate), or [faceswap](/api-reference/endpoint/faceswap) generation
